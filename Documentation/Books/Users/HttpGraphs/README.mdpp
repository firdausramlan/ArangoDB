`POST /_api/graph`*(create graph)*

!SUBSECTION Query parameters

`waitForSync (boolean,optional)`

Wait until document has been sync to disk.

!SUBSECTION Body parameters

`graph (json,required)`

The call expects a JSON hash array as body with the following attributes: _key: The name of the new graph. vertices: The name of the vertices collection. edges: The name of the egde collection.

!SUBSECTION Description

Creates a new graph.
Returns an object with an attribute graph containing a list of all graph properties.

!SUBSECTION Return codes

`HTTP 201`

is returned if the graph was created successfully and waitForSync was true.

`HTTP 202`

is returned if the graph was created successfully and waitForSync was false.

`HTTP 400`

is returned if it failed. The response body contains an error document in this case.

*Examples*

```
unix> curl -X POST --data-binary @- --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/graph/
{"_key":"graph","vertices":"vertices","edges":"edges"}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
etag: 103998433

{ 
  "graph" : { 
    "_id" : "_graphs/graph", 
    "_rev" : "103998433", 
    "_key" : "graph", 
    "edges" : "edges", 
    "vertices" : "vertices" 
  }, 
  "error" : false, 
  "code" : 201 
}
```

`GET /_api/graph/graph-name`*(get the properties of a specific or all graphs)*

!SUBSECTION URL parameters

`graph-name (string,optional)`

The name of the graph.

!SUBSECTION HTTP header parameters

`If-None-Match (string,optional)`

If graph-name is specified, then this header can be used to check whether a specific graph has changed or not.
If the "If-None-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one etag. The document is returned if it has a different revision than the given etag. Otherwise a HTTP 304 is returned.

`If-Match (string,optional)`

If graph-name is specified, then this header can be used to check whether a specific graph has changed or not.
If the "If-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one etag. The document is returned, if it has the same revision ad the given etag. Otherwise a HTTP 412 is returned. As an alternative you can supply the etag in an attribute rev in the URL.

!SUBSECTION Description

If graph-name is specified, returns an object with an attribute graph containing a JSON hash with all properties of the specified graph.

If graph-name is not specified, returns a list of graph objects.

!SUBSECTION Return codes

`HTTP 200`

is returned if the graph was found (in case graph-name was specified) or the list of graphs was assembled successfully (in case graph-name was not specified).

`HTTP 404`

is returned if the graph was not found. This response code may only be returned if graph-name is specified in the request. The response body contains an error document in this case.

`HTTP 304`

"If-None-Match" header is given and the current graph has not a different version. This response code may only be returned if graph-name is specified in the request.

`HTTP 412`

"If-Match" header or rev is given and the current graph has a different version. This response code may only be returned if graph-name is specified in the request.

*Examples*

get graph by name

```

    "vertices" : "vertices"
